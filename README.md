# Independent-study - material & device

I have experience in material and device research and use interdisciplinary skills to solve problems.

## [High-Entropy Alloy thin flim](https://github.com/masseraze/Independent-study-material-device/tree/main/high-entropy%20alloy%20thin%20film)
The high-entropy alloys have been reported to have unique properties such as the high-entropy effect, the lattice distortion effect, sluggish diffusion effect, and the cocktail effect, making their mechanical properties superior to most of the conventional alloys. However, more different impurities in an alloy will reduce the material's electrical conductance in general. 

We aims to exploit the field of high-conductive high-entropy alloys thin films, which is a rarely studied topic of the HEA field. With the help of first-principle molecular dynamics simulation, we are devoted to develop testing pins with high-strength, high-conductive high-entropy alloys coating.

## [Phase stability of thermoelectric material](https://github.com/masseraze/Independent-study-material-device/tree/main/phase%20stability%20of%20thermoelectric%20material)

Cu-based materials are mixed iconic-electronic conductors with  liquid-like sublattice and they have execellent ZT property in thermoeletric field.
However, the [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05248-8) points out that critical voltage will deposit Cu on  Cu<sub>2</sub>Se cathode because soret effect and solid state chemistry will impact on mixed iconic-electronic conductor.

Beside, electric current will affect phase equilibrium because of eletromigration mechanism so we have to clarify the difference .
The further detail of experiment is in the [file](https://github.com/masseraze/Independent-study-material-device/tree/main/phase%20stability%20of%20thermoelectric%20material)

#### Improvement
Samples are oxided when they are applied high dense electric current(3.5A), so we have to to do design beryllium window to get insight Cu<sub>2</sub>Se physical properties 

#### Self-design apparatus(beryllium window)
