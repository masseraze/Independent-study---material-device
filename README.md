# Independent-study - material & device

I have experienced in 

## [High-Entropy Alloy thin flim](https://github.com/masseraze/Independent-study-material-device/tree/main/high-entropy%20alloy%20thin%20film)


## [Phase stability of thermoelectric material](https://github.com/masseraze/Independent-study-material-device/tree/main/phase%20stability%20of%20thermoelectric%20material)

Cu-based materials are mixed iconic-electronic conductors with  liquid-like sublattice and they have execellent ZT property in thermoeletric field.
However, the [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05248-8) points out that critical voltage will deposit Cu on  Cu<sub>2</sub>Se cathode because soret effect and solid state chemistry will impact on mixed iconic-electronic conductor.

Beside, electric current will affect phase equilibrium because of eletromigration mechanism so we have to clarify the difference .

The further detail of experiment is in the [file](https://github.com/masseraze/Independent-study-material-device/tree/main/phase%20stability%20of%20thermoelectric%20material)

#### improvement
Samples are oxided when they are applied high dense electric current(3.5A), so we have to to do design beryllium window to get insight Cu<sub>2</sub>Se physical properties 

#### self-design apparatus(beryllium window)
