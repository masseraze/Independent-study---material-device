The in situ current stressing synchrotron radiation-based XRD was performed for the Cu2Se in this time's experiment. We used the grazing incident angle XRD method to perform the experiment. Figure 1 shows the XRD pattern for the as-received Cu2Se sample and it showed an alpha structure (monoclinic).

Figure 2 shows the XRD pattern evolution under pure aging of 750K for 20 min. We found that the alpha structure would transform into beta structure (cubic). This agrees with the phase diagram that 750K is the single phase region for beta phase.

After aging, we directly gave the electric current of 3.5 A to the sample. Figure 3 shows the XRD pattern evolution under current at 750K. We found that the beta structure seemed partially transformed back to the alpha phase after current stressing for 14 min. After 35 min-current stressing, a small peak was found at 15.8 degree. We still cannot tell which phase was this peak related to at this stage.

But interestingly, we found that after this peak appeared, the reading voltage started to drop at time of cathode 35 min, as shown in Figure 4. This reading voltage drop was related to the resistance drop of the sample, which was consistent with [Nature communication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05248-8). Please note that the reading voltage referred here was only the reading voltage value from the power supply. After 49 min of current stressing, the peak intensity at 15.8 degree was found increased.

We then ceased the applied voltage and the heat. After the sample was cooled back to the ambient temperature, XRD was performed again, as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a shows that the sample transformed back to the alpha structure and the peak at the 15.8 degree still existed. We further performed a theta-2theta method to see the inner structure information change. Figure 5b shows an alpha-structure pattern without the appearance of the 15.8-peak. It seems that this 15.8-peak was related to a segregation at the surface.

In summary, it is likely that the phase transformation occurred under electric current. It seems that alpha-phase would be formed under current stressing at 750 K for the Cu2Se sample. The phase transformation therefore induced the resistance change. The result seems positive and very interesting to keep going on. More detailed and further analysis would be required.
